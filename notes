Major problems faced by the solar industry.

1.No generation when then sun sets down.
A = Negligible scope. We cannot control the amount of light.

2.Cleaning the panels regularly. Cleaning panels of large solar farms is wastage of lots of water.
A = Develop alternate ways of cleaning such as using air blasts. we can use image processing to find if the panels are not clean. And in extreme cases use water. This way we can save water. By detecting the amount of dust we can decide if we need to clean the panel. Use drones for surveillance. Use weather to predict surveillance scheduling. Putting a camera at each panel would be highly costly.

3.Small shadow on the panel can disrupt the generation of whole string.
A = Not much scope, or can't think of any feasible or robust solution.

4.Costly replacement of batteries in off-grid plants.
A = Develop idea for proper usage and maintenance of batteries.


6.Finding faults and maintenance of big solar farms is hard because of large size.
A = Develop a SCADA like system which tells if there is any fault in any of the panels.


7. Where to setup these power plants?
A =
